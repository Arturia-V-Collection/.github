## About Arturia Analog Lab
Analog Lab is a comprehensive virtual instrument that serves as a gateway to Arturia's acclaimed V Collection. It consolidates the most expressive and usable presets from dozens of faithfully recreated classic keyboards, synthesizers, and electric pianos into a single, streamlined plugin.

Whether used as a standalone application or within a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), Analog Lab delivers professional-grade sound quality and reliability.
